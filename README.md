# ShopSync

ShopSync is an open-source toolkit for syncing product inventory across e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, eBay, Reverb, and Shopify. The goal is to provide a low-cost alternative (~$20/month or one-time fee) to existing services.

## Features

- Sync inventory counts across supported marketplaces.
- Choose your preferred marketplace as the system of record to avoid maintaining a separate inventory backend.
- Extensible architecture for adding new integrations.

## Roadmap

1. Implement core sync engine.
2. Add connectors for Amazon, eBay, Reverb, and Shopify.
3. Provide CLI and scheduling capabilities.
